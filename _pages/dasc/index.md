<p>As computer and communication systems as well as other systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Autonomous Robotic Systems become increasingly large and complex, their Dependability and Security play critical role at supporting next-generation science, engineering, and commercial applications. It remains a challenge to design, analyze, evaluate, and improve the dependability and security for a trusted computing environment. Trusted computing targets computing systems as well as services that are dependable, secure, protectable, predictable, traceable, controllable, autonomous, and sustainable.</p>

<p>
At the same time, the increasing scale and complexity of systems call for the autonomic computing paradigm, which meets the requirements of self-management, and autonomous systems. Trusted and autonomic computing/autonomous systems need synergistic research efforts covering many disciplines, ranging from natural sciences to social sciences. It requires scientific and technological advances in a wide variety of fields, as well as new software, architectures, and communication technology that support the integration of the constituent technologies.

IEEE DASC 2024 will be held during November 5-8, 2024, in Boracay, Philippines co-located with <a href="http://cyber-science.org/2024/cyberscitech/">IEEE CyberSciTech 2024</a>, 
<a href="http://cyber-science.org/2024/picom/">IEEE PICom 2024</a>, and <a href="http://cyber-science.org/2024/cbdcom/">IEEE CBDCom 2024</a>. It aims to bring together computer scientists, industrial engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange theoretical and implementation results, novel designs, work-in-progress, experience, case studies, and trend-setting ideas in the areas of dependability, security, trust and/or autonomic computing, and autonomous systems.
