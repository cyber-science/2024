<b>Abstract: </b> Modern distributed systems also deal with uncertain scenarios, where environments, infrastructures, and applications are widely diverse. In the scope of IoT-Edge-Fog-Cloud computing, leveraging these neuroscience-inspired principles and mechanisms could aid in building more flexible solutions able to generalize over different environments. A captivating set of hypotheses from the field of neuroscience suggests that human and animal brain mechanisms result from a few powerful principles. If proved to be accurate, these assumptions could open a deep understanding of the way humans and animals manage to cope with the unpredictability of events and imagination.

<b>Abstract: </b> Japan entered a super-aged society [percentage of old people (≥ 65 yrs old) ≥ 21%] in 2005. Nowadays, the aging problem in Japan is very serious. As a measure to cope with aging, research related to assistive robots has been widely carried out. In this talk, I will explain how we process physiological and motor signals and make full use of them to build control systems for the assistive robots we have developed, using examples of an electric trolley, a left-right independent treadmill, and a sit-to-stand assistive machine.
